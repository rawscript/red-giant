🧠 Red Giant Protocol - Concurrent Processing Demo
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 Original data: 3100 bytes
🔧 Chunk size: 128 bytes
📊 Expected chunks: 25

🔐 Phase 1: Secure Handshake
   ✓ Concurrent TLS-like channel established
   ✓ Mutual authentication complete

🧭 Phase 2: Concurrent Orchestrator
📡 Phase 3: Multi-Worker Receiver
📡 Concurrent Receiver: Starting multi-threaded file construction
🚀 Spawning 6 concurrent workers
   ✓ Concurrent receiver initialized with 6 workers

🛠 Phase 4: Concurrent Exposure Process
🧭 Concurrent Red Giant Protocol - Beginning Exposure
📋 File: rg_concurrent_1754229071 (3100 bytes, 25 chunks)

🚩 Phase 5: Concurrent Completion
