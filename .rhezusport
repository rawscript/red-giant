Red Giant on Google Cloud → Provides the high-speed transfer endpoint
File Sharing App on Vercel → Provides the user interface
Integration → File Sharing App communicates with Red Giant for transfers
Step-by-Step Deployment:
1. Deploy Red Giant Protocol to Google Cloud:
bash
# Using the existing deploy script
./deploy.sh gcp
# This gives you a URL like: https://redgiant-xyz-uc.a.run.app
2. Configure your File Sharing App with that Red Giant URL:
jsx
// In your file sharing app
const RED_GIANT_URL = "https://redgiant-xyz-uc.a.run.app";
3. Deploy File Sharing App to Vercel:
bash
# Build and deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
# This gives you a URL like: https://fileshare-yourname.vercel.app
